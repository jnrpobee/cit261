            <h1 style="text-align: center"><b>The Lord Speaks to us</b></h1>
        <p>In the 9th verse of the article of faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints states that "we believe all that God has reveived all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertainig to the Kingdom of God". All that the Lord reveals unto us comes through those He has called as Prophets. In Amos chapter three verse seven we learn that “…God reveals His secret unto His servant the prophets", there is no greater way to receive the words of the Lord except through these men. </p>
            <p>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints, general conference are held twice every year thus in the months of April and October. During this period members of The Church around the world gather together to listen to the Voice of the Prophets as they reveal unto us what the Lord will want us do.</p>
            <p>Below are selections from past conferences and new revelations given us by the Lord's Chosen in the most recent general Conference.</p>
